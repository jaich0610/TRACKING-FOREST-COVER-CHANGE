# TRACKING-FOREST-COVER-CHANGE
The purpose of this data analysis report is to track forest cover change over three different time
periods using satellite imagery and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The
analysis aims to identify areas where forest cover has potentially changed over time and
provide insights into the dynamics of forest ecosystems.
